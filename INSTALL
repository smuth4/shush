-- shush dependencies

If you want Perl Compatible Regular Expression support, you'll need the
PCRE library:

+ pcre: http://www.pcre.org/

Although this package uses autoconf, there is no real attempt to make sure
it works on older UNIX systems as it relies on a number of somewhat modern
system calls.

-- shush installation notes

(1) ./configure

    The following options are of interest:

	--with-pcre	 Where to find the PCRE lib if you want PCRE support.

	--with-syslog	 Default syslog facility to use.      (Default: cron)

	--with-sizelimit Default output size limit for mail.  (Default: 1000k)

    The latter should be set accordingly with your site's MTA configuration.

(2) make
(3) make install
